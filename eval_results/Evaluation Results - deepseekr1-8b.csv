- Fighting: All entries have a Global_Sales of 1.76, resulting in a mean of 1.76 and a standard deviation of 0. This indicates no variability in sales, making it a lower-risk category.

- Sports: The mean is approximately 1.7733, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.0188, indicating slightly more variability in sales.


Since higher standard deviation implies higher risk due to greater variability in sales, the Sports genre is considered higher risk compared to Fighting.
